Operator - a special function that is syntactically written differently.

Infix notation - function name (operator) sits between args

+(3,4) --> 3+4

Operator precedence and associativity: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

Associativity dictates in what order operator functions get called in - left to right or right to left - when
functions have the same precedence.

Example 1

var a = 2, var b = 3, var c = 4

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)

All are equal 4 - > because of associativity (right to left)

Example 2

console.log(1<2<3) true
console.log(3<2<1) true

3<2<1 --> false<1 --> 0<1 --> true
